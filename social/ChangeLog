	  Upgrade mysql.sql schema with latest.

	* engine/tests/objects/entities.php,
	  engine/tests/objects/objects.php, engine/tests/test_skeleton.php:
	  Swallowing all Elgg notices within unit tests.
	  
	  By default, SimpleTest converts PHP errors into exceptions. This
	  is restricted by adding a call to swallowErrors() within the
	  tearDown() methods. This has also been noted within the unit test
	  skeleton.

	  Restricting testing suite to only be run as a logged-in user.
	  This will not allow the tests to be run from the command line,
	  but this is already the case due to debug static.

	  Because of this I have raised mbstring from recommended to a
	  (non-fatal) core requirement.
	  
	  Because of the lack of a unicode ctype_alnum function the
	  validation occurs at username input. Because of this I have
	  improved the user registration code:
	  
	  This code now validates for special chars etc in the username. I
	  have also introduced the following new plugin hooks (which are
	  run after primary validation) which provide plugins with the
	  ability to add other requirements (extra security etc).
	  
	  'registeruser:validate:password'
	  'registeruser:validate:username'
	  'registeruser:validate:email'

	  references it
	  [10:06:11] … it needs a counter
	  [10:06:29] … which means for every add and delete query you need
	  to check for and sometimes update this counter
	  [10:06:36] … making three queries for every one
	  [10:06:47] … but if you don't do that the meta strings table
	  grows over time
	  [10:06:54] … making it space inefficient
	  [10:07:03] … so, which do you do?
	  [10:10:31] … ?
	  [10:10:43] … i'd be tempted to not delete
	  [10:10:58] … because the multiple queries will be a pain for
	  everyone all the time
	  [10:11:05] … and storage costs are cheap
	  [10:11:32] Ben Werdmuller: I would be very tempted to do the same
	  [10:11:35] … so let's do that :)
	  [10:11:36] Marcus Povey: maybe we could write an admin script to
	  clean up or something
	  [10:11:45] Ben Werdmuller: exactly, we could clean up on a cron
	  if people really want
	  [10:11:59] … but for now, let's just go with the growing tag
	  cloud
