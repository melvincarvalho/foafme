	  entities and implemented a clone method. The clone copies over
	  all metadata but not annotations and private settings. It sets

	  saved

2009-12-20  cash

	  container_guid now

	  Problem seems to be based around the action_gatekeeper() and the
	  values set for the __elgg_session. Removing this component from
	  the key causes the token to be valid.
	  
	  My feeling is that the session is not being saved or loaded
	  correctly.

	  possible:
	  
	  For themes to override, create a plugin hook listening to
	  'entity:icon:url' and object 'user'.
	  
	  In the hook return a different url.
	  
	  To replace default user icons in a plugin one might create a
	  hook:
	  
	  function profile_usericon_hook($hook, $entity_type, $returnvalue,
	  $params)
	  {
	  if ((!$returnvalue) && ($params['entity'] instanceof ElggUser))
	  {
	  // return your default graphic here.
	  }
	  }
	  
	  And set it to priority 900 (lower priority than the code that
	  displays a pretty icon for users but higher than the default
	  object display code in entities.php)
	* Allowing '.' in username, refs #415
	* Fixes #413: Rss feeds with GET query strings now functioning.

2008-08-25  marcus

	* Closes #254: If mb_string is installed then internationalised
	  usernames are supported in file system.
	  
	  Because of this I have raised mbstring from recommended to a
	  (non-fatal) core requirement.
	  
	  Because of the lack of a unicode ctype_alnum function the
	  validation occurs at username input. Because of this I have
	  improved the user registration code:
	  
	  This code now validates for special chars etc in the username. I
	  have also introduced the following new plugin hooks (which are
	  run after primary validation) which provide plugins with the
	  ability to add other requirements (extra security etc).
	  
	  'registeruser:validate:password'
	  'registeruser:validate:username'
	  'registeruser:validate:email'

	  [10:06:07] … if you want to delete the tag when nothing
	  references it
	  [10:06:11] … it needs a counter
	  [10:06:29] … which means for every add and delete query you need
	  to check for and sometimes update this counter
	  [10:06:36] … making three queries for every one
	  [10:06:47] … but if you don't do that the meta strings table
	  grows over time

	  [10:07:03] … so, which do you do?
	  [10:10:31] … ?
	  [10:10:43] … i'd be tempted to not delete
	  [10:10:58] … because the multiple queries will be a pain for
	  everyone all the time
	  [10:11:05] … and storage costs are cheap
	  [10:11:32] Ben Werdmuller: I would be very tempted to do the same
	  [10:11:35] … so let's do that :)
	  [10:11:36] Marcus Povey: maybe we could write an admin script to
	  clean up or something
	  [10:11:45] Ben Werdmuller: exactly, we could clean up on a cron
	  if people really want
	  [10:11:59] … but for now, let's just go with the growing tag
	  cloud
